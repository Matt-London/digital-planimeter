# digital-planimeter
Code and STLs to create a digital planimeter from a mouse sensor.

## State of project
While it is working and I consider the code complete, it certainly isn't perfect. I've left a few lines of code commented out and there is for sure room for improvement. This is more meant to be an exploration than perfect code and design.

## Setup instructions
If there is any interest I can write up some detailed instructions on how to get yourself up and running with this code. For right now I'll leave it as it is.

## Parts used
- Seeed Studio Xiao ESP32-C6

- Lychee Wireless Optical Pocket Pen Mouse
    - PAW3205DB-TJ3T Photosensor
