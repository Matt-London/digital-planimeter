# digital-planimeter
Code and STLs to create a digital planimeter from a mouse sensor.

## State of project
While it is working and I consider the code complete, it certainly isn't perfect. I've left a few lines of code commented out and there is for sure room for improvement. This is more meant to be an exploration than perfect code and design.
